# First-Ai-learning-project-

# Painting 

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![bicycle ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUVT73k7QxOEVBIm8uWAuF-FHLu8DqVfUj8n25BC_6ZEb3BUQC_OXU8po&s=10)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUVT73k7QxOEVBIm8uWAuF-FHLu8DqVfUj8n25BC_6ZEb3BUQC_OXU8po&s=10" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
main()
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
Canyon[Canyon API](https://www.canyon.com/en-my/blog-content/gravel-bike-news/cyclocross-guide/b27082024.html)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
