## Summary

 Ultimate cyclocross guide: All you need to know about cyclocross racing 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Bikes, races, mud and madness: that’s cyclocross racing. Learn about the sport, its roots, training strategies and pro tips from Canyon athletes to ride like a champion. 

What is cyclocross racing?

Cyclocross – shortened to CX or cross – is an offroad form of bike racing, often described as a mix of road cycling, mountain biking and steeplechase.  

The sport sees participants take on a closed-circuit mixed terrain course, typically 1-3km long, in a race that lasts 30 minutes to an hour. 

Cyclocross races emphasise high-intensity effort and skills beyond simple bike handling. With their sharp turns, hurdles, tree roots and obstacles, multi-terrain course conditions force riders to dismount and carry their bikes on hill climbs and wooded trails.  

Adding to the challenge, races generally take place in autumn or winter—strong winds, rainfall and muddy courses are all part of the fun! 


Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![bicycle ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUVT73k7QxOEVBIm8uWAuF-FHLu8DqVfUj8n25BC_6ZEb3BUQC_OXU8po&s=10)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUVT73k7QxOEVBIm8uWAuF-FHLu8DqVfUj8n25BC_6ZEb3BUQC_OXU8po&s=10" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```

print("Hello World")

main()
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
